This is a collections of scripts I found useful. Shell scripts are for bash use. 

I take no responsability for any damange these scripts may cause, use at your own risk.


addSite-x scripts information. This will create a vhost for nginx or apache (depending on which script). These scripts use php5-fpm, so if you do not have that setup install it. They are also suppose to be ran on debian based systems. If you are not on debian, I doubt they will work properly. If you find any issues or have improvements, leave me a message please. I am all for beefing these up to make them more streamlined. The addSite also setups an ftp account using vsftpd, if you do not want this, just remove that section. If you do you will need to configure vsftpd to use the /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list for allowed users.  

organizePhotos - this script I took mostly from another user but it is a great script. I modified it a bit, but basically this will look at the photos time stamps and allows you to organize them / rename etc by that. I plan on working on this a bit to be a bit more functional such as taking in parameters for the paths and having flags for copy or move and to create directories / rename etc...when I get around to it. For now it is basic and you need to modify the values accordingly. This requires the exiftool to run, apt-get install exiftool .
